# Set Up Ethernet over USB - Mac

When you are in a busy or restricted network environment, connect to the Intel® Edison using the device mode micro-USB cable and a virtual Ethernet connection known as "Ethernet over USB". Ethernet over USB uses the RNDIS protocol.

This document will guide you through obtaining an IP address for the Intel® Edison in order to program your board offline using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit IDEs.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: At this time, Ethernet over USB on Mac is not officially supported.**

HoRNDIS has been found to crash some computers running Mac OS. Please proceed with caution and only attempt to use Ethernet over USB if you are unable to use Wi-Fi.

If you have access to a Wi-Fi network, instead follow [Connect Your Intel Edison to Wi-Fi »](/connectivity/wifi/connect.md)

## Install HoRNDIS

Install the HoRNDIS (pronounced "horrendous") kernel extension to use Ethernet over USB via the RNDIS protocol on your Mac. You must reboot your computer after installing HoRNDIS. [View detailed instructions »](details-install_horndis.md)

## Configure network settings

Update your computer's Network configuration with a static IP address to use Ethernet over USB. [View detailed instructions »](details-configure_mac_network.md)

## Share your computer's WiFi connection (optional)

Turn on Internet Sharing to cut down on Wi-Fi traffic in a crowded room. Sharing your computer's internet connection also means that you can log into networks that have HTML password pages and then share the connection with the Intel® Edison. Internet sharing is an optional step but is highly recommended if you are at a hackathon. [View detailed instructions »](details-share_internet.md)
