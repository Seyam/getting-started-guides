## Connect Your Intel Edison to Wi-Fi

The Intel® Edison has built-in Wi-Fi that you can turn on by logging into your board and enabling. This setup document will guide you through connecting the Intel® Edison board to the Internet using Wi-Fi.

Once your board is online, turn your Intel® Edison into a true "Internet of Things" device. You will also need the IP address of your Intel® board to program it using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit IDEs.

**What network is your computer using?**

To avoid any issues with firewalls and proxies, the IoT board and your computer should be on the same internet network. 

Note: Many larger companies have strict internet security policies and restrict direct IP address access of computers and devices that are on the same internal network.

## Connect to a Wi-Fi network

Shell into your Intel® Edison and run the `configure_edison --wifi` command. Choose a Wi-Fi network to connect to, then input any login credentials for that network. [View detailed instructions »](details-configure_edison_wifi.md)

## Identify the IP address

Once your Intel® Edison is online, identify the IP address using the `configure_edison --showWiFiIP` or `ip a` commands in order to: manually add an IP to an Intel® IoT Developer Kit IDE, use with SSH clients, or use your IoT device as a web server.
