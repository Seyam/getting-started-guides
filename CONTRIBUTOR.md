## Branches

### branch: master

[github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides)

Currently straight Markdown-formatted docs. This is where everyone is editing content and can continue to edit content for now. After the dust settles from the LA Roadshow, this branch will probably be shut down and replaced by the "jekyll" branch. 

### branch: jekyll

[github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/jekyll](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/jekyll)

See [the branch's README](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/blob/jekyll/README.md) for how to preview/build content in this branch.

Note: Once I'm fully done with the content sweep, when we make edits to content, we'll have to update the .md files on BOTH 'master' and 'jekyll' branches. I will let you know when/if this needs to happen but I plan to finish the sweep in the next couple of hours.

### branch: html

[github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/html](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/html)

THIS IS THE BRANCH THAT WILL BE PUT ON USB KEYS. Static files need to be generated form the 'jekyll' branch. See [the branch's README](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/blob/html/README.md) for details on running a local web server to view files.

### branch: gh-pages

[github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/intel-iot-roadshow/getting-started-guides/tree/gh-pages)

Github's built in web server for viewing html files: [intel-iot-roadshow.github.io/getting-started-guides/](http://intel-iot-roadshow.github.io/getting-started-guides/). Feel free to send anyone to this url if they are unable to get the USB key files working. Static files need to be generated form the 'jekyll' branch.

## Markdown files

All content (with a few exceptions) are written in Markdown, mixed with some HTML. The flavour of Markdown used by the current Jekyll templating system is 'kramdown'.

### Templating

All content files (found in the 'docs' folder) must start with a snippet like this:

```
---
layout: default
title: Getting Started
---
```

### Headings

Headings get `id` attributes automatically generated for them. To create a table of contents, wrap it in a `div` with `id="toc" class="box" markdown="1"`. Setting `markdown="1"` means that you can write markdown within the html block. An example Table of Contents:

```
<div id="toc" class="box" markdown="1">
* [Install Intel® Edison standalone drivers »](#install-intel-edison-standalone-drivers)
* [Install FTDI serial drivers »](#install-ftdi-serial-drivers)
* [Restart your computer »](#restart-your-computer)
</div>
```

### Videos

Let's comment out videos for now but eventually they will look be embedded on the page with width="565" and height="367". For example:

```
<div id="related-videos" class="callout video">
  <object id="flashObj" width="565" height="367" ...
  <embed ... name="flashObj" width="565" height="367" ...></embed></object>
</div>
```

### TLDR summary

The html for summary boxes for each section (with the blue roadsign icon, which I call the "Too long, didn't read" box) look like this:

```
<div class="tldr" markdown="1">
Some 1-2 sentence blurb
</div>
```

### Callout boxes

The html for other callboxes boxes look like this:

```
<div class="callout info" markdown="1">
**Bolded Title (optional)**

Some stuff.
</div>
```

Or when there are multiple items, use a horizontal rule to divide them.

```
<div class="callout info" markdown="1">
**First Title**

First thing

---

**Second Title**

Second thing
</div>
```

Check the CSS file for final callout box options but so far they are:

* info
* goto
* troubleshooting
* done
* warning
* danger


### Next steps

The closing (blue) box at the bottom of the page has this markup:

```
<div id="next-steps" class="note" markdown="1">
Link with where to go next
</div>
```


## Style Guide

Many of these docs originated as a Google Doc and PDFs. Some of the points in the [original style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-UeNNmMEX-wXcJLTrflbCm_L93bq3g0aa2CTHNf6Aw/preview) may not apply to these Markdown docs but still worth a read. 

### Language

* Explain what **and why** but keep it short and sweet.
* Keep "skimmability" in mind at all times. No one reads every word so make important ones **jump** out using bold or italics.
* Use numbered lists and bullet points. Avoid rambling in paragraphs.
* Make the content impersonal, gender neutral, and action-oriented -- this content is meant to be re-used across different mediums and platforms. Jokes do not translate well.

### Images

* **Show, don't tell**: Add screenshots and/or photos for clarity.
* However, having said that, even when using an image **do not leave out text-based instructions** for accessibility reasons.
* For ease of translation, do not put text overlays in images. Use numbered or lettered captions, if necessary.
* To show an action, put together a before & after montage or consider an [animated gif](https://github.com/vvo/gifify).
* Use #ff8c00 orange for callout arrows and circles. (Avoid #e21f20 red callouts unless it is actually an indication of an error or danger.)
* Crop images to bring extra attention to the important area and to save space — but make sure to keep context (ie. don't overcrop).
* Compress your images before adding to the repo. Try [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or similiar tools.

### Command line input

* Make commands that a reader needs to type jump out and easy to copy/paste by using a single backtick (\`) or [triple backticks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks) (```) for multiple lines.

### Code samples

* Make code easy to copy/paste -- use [triple backticks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks) (```) for code blocks.
* 2 spaces (not tabs)

## Possible additions

### Want to add a new breakout board?

1. Add it to the main [README.md](README.md)
2. Create a sub-folder in the [assembly folder](/assembly) for the new board
  * Create a doc for **assembly**
  * And another **connecting_cables** doc that is more like an appendix
3. Create an end-to-end guide in the [START_HERE folder](START_HERE/) for some basic Hello World app

### Want to add a new sensor kit?

1. Create a sub-folder in the [sensor examples folder](/sensor_examples) for the new kit
  * Create an **intro** doc
  * Put code samples into a language specific folder (since there will likely be different screenshots/gifs/videos for different languages)
