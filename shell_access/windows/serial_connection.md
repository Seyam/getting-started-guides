# Shell Access - Windows

![computer icon with command prompt](../images/icon-computer_shell.png)

If you need to configure your IoT board, you will need to remotely connect to the Intel® Edison or Intel® Galileo. Once connected to your Intel® IoT board, you have access to the Linux-based Yocto operating system running on the board. 

You can then execute special Linux commands such: changing the hostname and password, setting up Wi-Fi, or flashing new firmware.

## Download a terminal client (PuTTY)

Windows does not come with a built-in terminal emulator so download and use the [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) client. [View detailed instructions »](details-putty.md)

## Identify the serial COM port

Use Device Manager to find the COM port number for the "**USB Serial Port**" connection. You will need the COM # to configure PuTTY in Establish a serial connection. [View detailed instructions »](details-identify_com_port.md)

## Establish a serial connection

Use PuTTY to establish a **serial** connection to the IoT board using the COM # you noted in the previous [Identify the serial COM port](#identify-the-serial-com-port) section and the baud rate **115200**. [View detailed instructions »](details-putty_serial_connection.md)

You are now logged into your IoT board and can run shell commands. For example, to output the version number of the firmware running on your board:

```
cat /etc/version
```

![example output after running cat command](../images/firmware_version_output.png)

The firmware version is in YYYYMMDDHHMM format so, in this case, Sept 3, 2014.

### Next Steps

Some Edison boards have older firmware images on them. You _may_ need to update the firmware to a newer version to get access to important features.
