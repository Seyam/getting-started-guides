# Shell Access - Mac 

![computer icon with command prompt](../images/icon-computer_shell.png)

If you need to configure your IoT board, you will need to remotely connect to the Intel® Edison or Intel® Galileo. Once connected to your Intel® IoT board, you have access to the Linux-based Yocto operating system running on the board. 

You can then execute special Linux commands such: changing the hostname and password, setting up Wi-Fi, or flashing new firmware.

## Identify the "usbserial" device name 

Use the `ls /dev/tty.*` command in Terminal to find the device name of the "**usbserial**" connection. You will need the exact device name for use in [Establish a serial connection](#establish-a-serial-connection) next. [View detailed instructions »](details-identify_usbserial.md)

## Establish a serial connection

Use the Screen utility in Terminal to gain command line access of your IoT board. For example: `screen /dev/tty.usbserial-A102GW3T 115200`. [View detailed instructions »](details-screen_connection.md)

You are now logged into your IoT board and can run shell commands. For example, to output the version number of the firmware running on your board:

```
cat /etc/version
```

![example output after running cat command](../images/firmware_version_output.png)

The firmware version is in YYYYMMDDHHMM format so, in this case, Sept 3, 2014.

### Next Steps

Some Edison boards have older firmware images on them. You **_may_** need to update the firmware to a newer version to get access to important features.
