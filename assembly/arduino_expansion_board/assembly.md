## Quick Start Assembly Instructions


### Install the Intel® Edison module

The Intel® Edison module is meant to be used with breakout boards or custom PCBs. You will need to secure your Intel® Edison module to the Arduino expansion board before you can use it.

### Install the plastic spacers

To add stability to the expansion board and to help avoid accidental short circuits, attach the four plastic spacers supplied in your Intel® Edison box to act as "legs" for the expansion board.

## Example of a full development setup

While plugging in every cable is not required at this very moment, a development setup with serial communication for shell access would look like this:

1. **microswitch** in "USB device mode" (i.e. toggled **_down_** towards the micro-USB ports)
2. **device mode micro-USB cable** plugged into your computer
3. **UART/serial micro-USB cable** plugged into your computer

The Arduino expansion board for Intel® Edison can be powered via the DC power jack, the device mode micro-USB port, or both. This setup uses only a micro-USB cable for power.
