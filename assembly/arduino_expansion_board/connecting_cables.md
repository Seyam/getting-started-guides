## Device mode vs host mode

The hardware slider on the Arduino expansion board switches between USB _host mode_ and USB _device mode_. 

**Device mode:** The switch is toggled down and a micro-USB cable can be used to turn the Intel® Edison into a computer peripheral. Device mode allows you to do such things as: program the board over USB, or mount the onboard flash memory like a disk drive. Refer to [Device mode micro-USB cable »](#device-mode-micro-usb-cable)

**Host mode:** The switch is toggled up and USB peripherals with a standard-sized USB cable (such as mice, keyboards, etc) can be plugged into the Intel® Edison. USB host mode requires the use of an external power adapter. Refer to [Host mode USB cable  »](#host-mode-usb-cable)

## Device mode micro-USB cable

Use the top micro-USB port in USB device mode for:

* 5V power, 
* programming the Intel® Edison using the Arduino IDE, 
* programming the Intel® Edison using the Intel® XDK or Eclipse IDE included in the Intel® IoT Developer Kit via Ethernet over USB (not Wi-Fi), and
* writing to the onboard flash memory from your computer.

## UART/serial micro-USB cable

Use the bottom micro-USB port to send serial commands to your Intel® Edison via Terminal or PuTTY. Use these commands to flash firmware, configure Wi-Fi, or identify the board's IP address.

## DC power supply

If you are going to use more power intensive features such as Wi-Fi, a servo motor, or an Arduino shield, use a DC power supply in addition to the device mode micro-USB cable.

## Host mode USB cable

Use the standard-sized USB port in USB host mode to allow the Intel® Edison to accept USB peripherals such as mice, keyboards, etc.
