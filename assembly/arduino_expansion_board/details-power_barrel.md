## DC power supply

If you are going to use more power intensive features such as Wi-Fi, a servo motor, or an Arduino shield, use a DC power supply in addition to the device mode micro-USB cable.

1. Plug in a 7 to 15 VDC input DC power supply to the barrel connector.
  
  (This DC power supply could be plugged into the wall, or be part of a battery pack.)

2. A green LED should light up on the expansion board. Wait one minute for the IntelÂ® Edison to finish booting up.

When using DC power, if you do not need the device mode cable for programming, you can unplug it at this time. Same for the serial cable.
